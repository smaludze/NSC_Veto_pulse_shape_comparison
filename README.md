Goal of the analysis is to compare pulse shapes from two different types of interactions (electron recoil and nuclear recoil). Pulses from the cryogenic detector were pre-selected with certain conditions that each type of interaction would setisfy (based on the experimental setup and the detector configuation). Expected difference in the rising part of the pulse (cause by particle interaction within the detector).

2. Normalized distributions of rise times for each class. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40996191/179090553-407c3ca4-d484-4b92-a68d-211e5e394813.png)
3. Rise time vs Energy for each class. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40996191/179090580-27769003-2755-4ba3-bf10-51e5da675c7f.png) 4. rise time comparison amongst channels. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40996191/179090270-9de18cd3-144c-4e62-94cb-0f290198ffef.png) 5.
