Goal of the analysis is to overlay pulses from two different types of interactions (electron recoil and nuclear recoil) to observe different features in pulse shapes. Pulses from the cryogenic detector were selected with certain conditions that each type of interaction would setisfy (based on the experimental setup and detector configuation). ![overlaid_Pulses_perfect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40996191/178026839-e48b8b68-7c36-410e-a3f2-337435f7c0a2.png)
